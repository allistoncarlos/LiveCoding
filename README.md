# LiveCoding

This app is part of the interview process for the [Koombea](https://www.koombea.com) company, when I had the challenge do consume an heroku API, show the users in a View, and navigate to another one, detailing each user data.
Created using iOS17+ target framework, URLSession, CachedAsyncImage, and based on MVVM pattern.
